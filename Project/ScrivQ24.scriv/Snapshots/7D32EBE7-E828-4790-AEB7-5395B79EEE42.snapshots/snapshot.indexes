## New to Quarto?
Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system. Visit the [Get Started] guide to install so you can begin to create, build, and preview your documents.

I highly recommend visiting the [Tutorial: Hello, Quarto]. Youâ€™ll learn how to create a document, build it, and preview it. You will also be taken to the excellent [Quarto extension for VS Code] and [Quarto extension for R Studio] that will make your life much easier.

Find out more at [Awesome Quarto], [Quarto Extensions], [Quarto on Github], [RStudio Community], [Stack Overflow], [Twitter].

## Quarto Quickstart ðŸš€ 

  â€¢  On macOS ({{&lt; fa brands apple &gt;}}), use Homebrew to brew install quarto.
  â€¢  On Windows ({{&lt; fa brands windows &gt;}}), use Chocolatey to choco install quarto.
  â€¢  On Linux ({{&lt; fa brands linux &gt;}}), use your package manager to install quarto.

## Homebrew Quickstart ðŸš€

If you're on a Mac, install Homebrew. Open the launchpad, look for the Terminal, paste the command below, and press return. Fear not. Thy Mac shall be safe.

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

## New to Pandoc? 
Pandoc is a universal document converter developed by John MacFarlane, professor of philosophy, that is at the core of Quarto. To learn more about it, see the Pandoc Userâ€™s Guide [{{&lt; fa regular file-pdf &gt;}}. Quarto already includes a copy of Pandoc inside, but you can also install it as a separate standalone application, which I also recommend.

Check [Pandoc-Discuss] in case you have unsolved questions. You can also ask questions on [Pandoc at Stack Overflow].

On macOS, it might be a good idea to install Chromium (brew install chromium), if you intend to work with mermaid diagrams.
