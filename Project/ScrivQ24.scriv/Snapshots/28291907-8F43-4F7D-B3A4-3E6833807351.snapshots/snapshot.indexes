        <Text>ScrivQ is a sample Scrivener project to publish books with Quarto, an academic and technical publishing system built with Pandoc, the universal markup converter. Using ScrivQ to publish with Quarto is easy. We could use this very text section with raw markup to create any element in our book or website, or we could more easily use the affordances of ScrivQ.
The Templates section on top of the Binder is a starting place for new sections. Pick and configure any of the project section types (Div, Code, Metadata, Computation, Diagram Dot, Diagram Mermaid, Text, Anchored Text, Break and Text, Section, Break and Section, Heading, Break and Heading, Footnote, Equation, File) or experiment with some of the ready-made examples which show how to:
Create an Unnumbered Section or Appendix using a Section.
Create Amsthm elements (Conjecture, Corollary, Definition, Example, Exercise, Lemma, Proposition, Theorem), callouts (Callout Caution, Callout Important, Callout Note, Callout Tip, Callout Warning), multipart panels (Multiparts, Multipart Figure, Multipart Table, Figure) and environments (Column Page, Column Page‚ÜíRight, Column Page‚ÜêLeft, Column Screen, Column Margin) using a Div.
Create R Code and Python computations using a Computation (surprise, surprise!).
Create Callouts, Callouts (Raw), Code, Computation, Computation (Raw), Dot, Equation, Figure, Mermaid, Multipart Figure, Python, R, and Table using a simple Text section.
Create a Bibliography to place at the end of your text. 

## Bibliographies used in multiple locations need a different approach

Each bibliography part must be in a separate file, so 1. distribute your sources in as many sections as needed with the Section Type File to generate the bibliography files (e.g. [Primary Sources]($!), [Secondary Sources]($!)); then, 2. go to the [_quarto]($!) file and input them into the bibliography section according to the pattern indicated onsite. Finally, 3. add them anywhere using linked \&lt;$Custom:ID&gt; with the Div Bibliography style applied or using raw markup, as in:

:::{refs_\&lt;$Custom:ID&gt;
:::

## But should I use a specific Section Type or...?

Some elements can be created in a variety of ways (e.g., using Styles, Section Types, and Raw Markup). There is no single best option. We explore all of them in this template. 

## What does Section Type X mean again in terms of markup?

If you need to remember the markup around a particular section type, just check the Notes field of the corresponding template.

## Translating Quarto into Scrivener

In ScrivQ we can use Section Types or Paragraph Styles to create Sections, Tables, Equations, Figures, Listings, Callouts (Caution, Important, Note, Tip, Warning), and Amsthm environments (Conjecture, Corollary, Definition, Example, Exercise, Lemma, Proposition, Theorem). We can also use Character Styles to reference any of them. Keep reading to learn how.</Text>
