## First things first.

Before you try to compile, run a quarto check on your installation. Some Python and R computations will require additional packages (cf. lst-r-packages).

On Windows, you must install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads).

Ruby compile script

Ôøº
{#fig-scriv-compile width="auto"} There is a small ruby script that reformats the text from Scrivener to be compatible with Quarto. It allows you to pass a file name and a format, so you can edit the post-processing panel to change the output format (change html to pdf / docx / epub etc.). It is embedded in this project‚Äôs Compiler format.

The script‚Äôs output is redirected &amp;&gt; to a Quarto.log file and this log file will be opened after the compiler finishes so you can check any details or debug any errors‚Ä¶

:::


The ScrivQ template is designed to compile [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) [Books](https://quarto.org/docs/books/) (PDF*, DOCX, and HTML) with zero configuration. 
## How to use this template

There is no need to learn everything there is to it immediately. Hit ‚åò‚å•E to publish your own Quarto Book. Experiment with changing the parameters, and the text, and slowly but surely it will become your template too and you will soon be publishing books with it in no time at all.

The script‚Äôs output is redirected &amp;&gt; to a Quarto.log file and this log file will be opened after the compiler finishes so you can check any details or debug any errors. This compiler script descends from Scrivomatic but with heavy adaptations to allow splitting the final document into sub-files. This seemingly simple task introduces many challenges, as footnotes and image data must be moved around before the file is split. Check the compile script if you want to know how this got solved. Please report any errors.
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads) must be installed on Windows machines.
